# HOW TO USE MOD UPDATER
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/notlet/modupdater/releases).
2. Unzip all the contents of it to your instance's `.minecraft` folder. (for example `.minecraft/modupdater` folder)
3. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) and NPM (should be prepacked with Node) installed.
4. Run `install.bat` if you are using Windows, or `install.sh` if Linux.
5. Wait for the installer window to close.
6. To use the updater, run the `run.bat` file (Windows) or `run.sh` (Linux). You can add a shortcut to it on your desktop aswell.

To navigate in updater's menu, use arrow keys and enter. To select items in a multiple choice menu, navigate to it with arrows and press Space.
If you find any bugs, please report them to me, and I'll push out a fix asap.
